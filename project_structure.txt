MESSAGES :
	SRV : Server (Message going from sensors to the server)
	COM : Command (Message going from the server/computation node to the sensors)
	NDA & NDR : Neighbor Discovery Announce/Response (Message used for setup the mesh network)

SENSOR NODE
	
	SETUP : 
		1) Search for a computation node ==> PARENT = the nearest node (based on the signal strength)

	LOOP :

		-If PARENT disconnected ==> GOTO SETUP

		-If receive a NDA ==> Respond with a NDR
		-If receive a command from the server (COM message) 
			If for this node ==> Execute it (open/close).
			Else ==> Forward it
		-If receive a SRV message ==> Forward it

		-Send data to the server with the (SRV message) every minute.


COMPUTATION NODE
	
	SETUP : 
		1) Search for a computation node ==> PARENT = the nearest node (based on the signal strength)

	LOOP :

		-If PARENT disconnected ==> GOTO SETUP
		
		-If receive a NDA ==> Respond with a NDR
		-If receive a command from the server (COM message) 
			==> Forward it (COM message can't be for a computation node)

		-If receive a SRV message ==> Handle it / Forward it to the server

BORDER NODE
	
	SETUP :
		/

	LOOP :

		-If receive a NDA ==> Respond with a NDR
		-If receive a SRV message ==> Handle it
