MESSAGES :
	SRV : Server (Message going from sensors to the server)
	COM : Command (Message going from the server/computation node to the sensors)
	NDA & NDR : Neighbor Discovery Announce/Response (Message used for setup the mesh network)

Network setup :
	NDA : Neighbor Discovery Announce : Broadcast message sent to announce the new node to other
	NDR : Neighbor Discovery Response : Answer to the NDA messages (only sent by the already connected nodes, and the border node)

	Example : The node 1 is the border node, the node 2 is connected to it. The new node 3 try to connect to the network.

	The node 3 : "NDA" to all
	The node(s) that received the NDA from 3 : "NDR3"
	The node 3 will choose the best signal parent from the NDR(s).

	It's important to notice that the response contains the id of the destination node, to avoid loop.

Data messages from the sensors :
	SRV : Server message : Message sent by the sensors to inform the network about the air quality

	If air quality = 50 and node id = 2 :
	"SRV50002" will be sent (node ID are coding on 3 digits).

Order messages from the server / computation nodes :
	COM : Command message : Sent by the server or the computation nodes to order a sensor to open/close a valve.

	If we want to open the valve of the node 5 : 
	"COM1005" (open = 1 and close = 0 + node ID are still coding on 3 digits)
